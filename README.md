# agnoster-hostcolors

This is a fork of the [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) [agnoster theme](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/agnoster.zsh-theme)
with the additional feature of coloring the `user@host` prompt differently for different hosts, based on a color palette and a hash of the `user@host` string.
